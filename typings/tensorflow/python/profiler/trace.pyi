  """Context manager that generates a trace event in the profiler.

  A trace event will start when entering the context, and stop and save the
  result to the profiler when exiting the context. Open TensorBoard Profile tab
  and choose trace viewer to view the trace event in the timeline.

  Trace events are created only when the profiler is enabled. More information
  on how to use the profiler can be found at
  https://tensorflow.org/guide/profiler

  Example usage:
  ```python
  tf.profiler.experimental.start('logdir')
  for step in range(num_steps):
    # Creates a trace event for each training step with the step number.
    with tf.profiler.experimental.Trace("Train", step_num=step, _r=1):
      train_fn()
  tf.profiler.experimental.stop()

                Both the key and value are of types that

                interpreted by the profiler according to the

    Args:

    This method enables setting metadata in a trace event after it is
    created.

    Example usage:

    ```python

      def call(function):
        with tf.profiler.experimental.Trace("call",
             function_name=function.name) as tm:

          tm.set_metadata(in_cache=in_cache)
          execute(binary)

    ```
    In this example, we want to trace how much time spent on
    calling a function, which includes compilation and execution.
    The compilation can be either getting a cached copy of the
    binary or actually generating the binary, which is indicated
    by the boolean "in_cache" returned by jit_compile(). We need
    to use set_metadata() to pass in_cache because we did not know
    the in_cache value when the trace was created (and we cannot
    create the trace after jit_compile(), because we want
    to measure the entire duration of call()).
