"""Module implementing RNN Cells.

This module provides a number of basic commonly used RNN cells, such as LSTM
(Long Short Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and a number of
operators that allow adding dropouts, projections, or embeddings for inputs.
Constructing multi-layer cells is supported by the class `MultiRNNCell`, or by
calling the `rnn` ops several times.
