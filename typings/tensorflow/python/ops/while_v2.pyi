replace the current tf.while_loop implementation once it reaches feature and

  """FuncGraph for the gradient function of the body of a While op.

  Contains the logic for capturing the tensors from the body of the forward
  While op which is as follows:
  1. If the tensor is of resource type (these are not accumulated):
     a. Ensure that the tensor is a loop invariant, i.e., it exists in both loop
        inputs and outputs at the same index.
     b. Lookup the corresponding resource tensor in the forward outer graph and
        try to capture that.
  2. If the tensor is not of resource type:
     a. Create an accumulator for that tensor and output it from the forward
        pass. Note this also requires adding it as an input to the forward pass.
     b. Capture the accumulator from the forward pass in this FuncGraph. This
        will later be resolved to the correct output of the forward While op.
     c. Pop a value from the captured placeholder and use it as the captured
        value for the forward pass tensor.

  This only allows capturing tensors in the forward graph. A ValueError is
  raised if an attempt is made to capture a tensor not in the forward graph.
  To manually capture a tensor that is not in the forward graph, call `capture`
  with `allowlisted=True`.

  Note: The `captures` dict does not contain the forward tensor since it is not
  directly captured. It contains the accumulator corresponding to this forward
  tensor.

  Attributes:
    while_op_needs_rewrite: True if any non-resource intermediates were
      captured, meaning the forward While op needs to be rewritten to output the
      corresponding accumulators.
    extra_inputs: list of EmptyTensorList tensors to be used as initial input to
    the new accumulators in the forward graph. It may also contain external
    captures of the custom gradient function.
    internal_capture_to_output: dict from a tensor_id(captured placeholder) to
      the corresponding tensor that needs to be added to the list of outputs.
      For instance, when capturing an accumulator TensorList this contains the
      TensorList obtained after popping a tensor from the list. Other entries
      in this dict are expected, though not enforced, to be identities.
      This dict is needed because these output tensors need to be added to
      FuncGraph.outputs "after" the tensors returned from the gradient function.
