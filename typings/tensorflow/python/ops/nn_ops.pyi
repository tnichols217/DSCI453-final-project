"""Primitive Neural Net (NN) Operations.

## Notes on padding

Several neural network operations, such as `tf.nn.conv2d` and
`tf.nn.max_pool2d`, take a `padding` parameter, which controls how the input is
padded before running the operation. The input is padded by inserting values
(typically zeros) before and after the tensor in each spatial dimension. The
`padding` parameter can either be the string `'VALID'`, which means use no
padding, or `'SAME'` which adds padding according to a formula which is
described below. Certain ops also allow the amount of padding per dimension to
be explicitly specified by passing a list to `padding`.

In the case of convolutions, the input is padded with zeros. In case of pools,
the padded input values are ignored. For example, in a max pool, the sliding
window ignores padded values, which is equivalent to the padded values being
`-infinity`.

### `'VALID'` padding

Passing `padding='VALID'` to an op causes no padding to be used. This causes the
output size to typically be smaller than the input size, even when the stride is
one. In the 2D case, the output size is computed as:

```python
out_height = ceil((in_height - filter_height + 1) / stride_height)
out_width  = ceil((in_width - filter_width + 1) / stride_width)
```

The 1D and 3D cases are similar. Note `filter_height` and `filter_width` refer
to the filter size after dilations (if any) for convolutions, and refer to the
window size for pools.

### `'SAME'` padding

With `'SAME'` padding, padding is applied to each spatial dimension. When the
strides are 1, the input is padded such that the output size is the same as the
input size. In the 2D case, the output size is computed as:

```python
out_height = ceil(in_height / stride_height)
out_width  = ceil(in_width / stride_width)
```

The amount of padding used is the smallest amount that results in the output
size. The formula for the total amount of padding per dimension is:

```python
if (in_height % strides[1] == 0):
  pad_along_height = max(filter_height - stride_height, 0)
else:
  pad_along_height = max(filter_height - (in_height % stride_height), 0)
if (in_width % strides[2] == 0):
  pad_along_width = max(filter_width - stride_width, 0)
else:
  pad_along_width = max(filter_width - (in_width % stride_width), 0)
```

Finally, the padding on the top, bottom, left and right are:

```python
pad_top = pad_along_height // 2
pad_bottom = pad_along_height - pad_top
pad_left = pad_along_width // 2
pad_right = pad_along_width - pad_left
```

Note that the division by 2 means that there might be cases when the padding on
both sides (top vs bottom, right vs left) are off by one. In this case, the
bottom and right sides always get the one additional padded pixel. For example,
when pad_along_height is 5, we pad 2 pixels at the top and 3 pixels at the
bottom. Note that this is different from existing libraries such as PyTorch and
Caffe, which explicitly specify the number of padded pixels and always pad the
same number of pixels on both sides.

Here is an example of `'SAME'` padding:

>>> in_height = 5
>>> filter_height = 3
>>> stride_height = 2
>>>
>>> in_width = 2
>>> filter_width = 2
>>> stride_width = 1
>>>
>>> inp = tf.ones((2, in_height, in_width, 2))
>>> filter = tf.ones((filter_height, filter_width, 2, 2))
>>> strides = [stride_height, stride_width]
>>> output = tf.nn.conv2d(inp, filter, strides, padding='SAME')
>>> output.shape[1]  # output_height: ceil(5 / 2)
3
>>> output.shape[2] # output_width: ceil(2 / 1)
2

### Explicit padding

Certain ops, like `tf.nn.conv2d`, also allow a list of explicit padding amounts
to be passed to the `padding` parameter. This list is in the same format as what
is passed to `tf.pad`, except the padding must be a nested list, not a tensor.
For example, in the 2D case, the list is in the format `[[0, 0], [pad_top,
pad_bottom], [pad_left, pad_right], [0, 0]]` when `data_format` is its default
value of `'NHWC'`. The two `[0, 0]` pairs  indicate the batch and channel
dimensions have no padding, which is required, as only spatial dimensions can
have padding.

For example:

>>> inp = tf.ones((1, 3, 3, 1))
>>> filter = tf.ones((2, 2, 1, 1))
>>> strides = [1, 1]
>>> padding = [[0, 0], [1, 2], [0, 1], [0, 0]]
>>> output = tf.nn.conv2d(inp, filter, strides, padding=padding)
>>> tuple(output.shape)
(1, 5, 3, 1)
>>> # Equivalently, tf.pad can be used, since convolutions pad with zeros.
>>> inp = tf.pad(inp, padding)
>>> # 'VALID' means to use no padding in conv2d (we already padded inp)
>>> output2 = tf.nn.conv2d(inp, filter, strides, padding='VALID')
>>> tf.debugging.assert_equal(output, output2)

### Difference between convolution and pooling layers
How padding is used in convolution layers and pooling layers is different. For
convolution layers, padding is filled with values of zero, and padding is
multiplied with kernels. For pooling layers, padding is excluded from the
computation. For example when applying average pooling to a 4x4 grid, how much
padding is added will not impact the output. Here is an example that
demonstrates the difference.

>>> x_in = np.array([[
...   [[2], [2]],
...   [[1], [1]],
...   [[1], [1]]]])
>>> kernel_in = np.array([  # simulate the avg_pool with conv2d
...  [ [[0.25]], [[0.25]] ],
...  [ [[0.25]], [[0.25]] ]])
>>> x = tf.constant(x_in, dtype=tf.float32)
>>> kernel = tf.constant(kernel_in, dtype=tf.float32)
>>> conv_out = tf.nn.conv2d(x, kernel, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')
>>> pool_out = tf.nn.avg_pool(x, [2, 2], strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')
>>> print(conv_out.shape, pool_out.shape)
(1, 3, 2, 1) (1, 3, 2, 1)
>>> tf.reshape(conv_out, [3, 2]).numpy()  # conv2d takes account of padding
array([[1.5 , 0.75],
       [1.  , 0.5 ],
       [0.5 , 0.25]], dtype=float32)
>>> tf.reshape(pool_out, [3, 2]).numpy()  # avg_pool excludes padding
array([[1.5, 1.5],
       [1. , 1. ],
       [1. , 1. ]], dtype=float32)

  This has the effect of transforming sliding window operations into the
  corresponding "atrous" operation in which the input is sampled at the
  specified `dilation_rate`.

  In the special case that `dilation_rate` is uniformly 1, this simply returns:

    op(input, num_spatial_dims, padding)

  Otherwise, it returns:

    batch_to_space_nd(
      op(space_to_batch_nd(input, adjusted_dilation_rate, adjusted_paddings),
         num_spatial_dims,
         "VALID")
      adjusted_dilation_rate,
      adjusted_crops),

  where:

    adjusted_dilation_rate is an int64 tensor of shape [max(spatial_dims)],
    adjusted_{paddings,crops} are int64 tensors of shape [max(spatial_dims), 2]

  defined as follows:

  We first define two int64 tensors `paddings` and `crops` of shape
  `[num_spatial_dims, 2]` based on the value of `padding` and the spatial
  dimensions of the `input`:

  If `padding = "VALID"`, then:

    paddings, crops = required_space_to_batch_paddings(
      input_shape[spatial_dims],
      dilation_rate)

  If `padding = "SAME"`, then:

    dilated_filter_shape =
      filter_shape + (filter_shape - 1) * (dilation_rate - 1)

    paddings, crops = required_space_to_batch_paddings(
      input_shape[spatial_dims],
      dilation_rate,
      [(dilated_filter_shape - 1) // 2,
       dilated_filter_shape - 1 - (dilated_filter_shape - 1) // 2])

  Because `space_to_batch_nd` and `batch_to_space_nd` assume that the spatial
  dimensions are contiguous starting at the second dimension, but the specified
  `spatial_dims` may not be, we must adjust `dilation_rate`, `paddings` and
  `crops` in order to be usable with these operations.  For a given dimension,
  if the block size is 1, and both the starting and ending padding and crop
  amounts are 0, then space_to_batch_nd effectively leaves that dimension alone,
  which is what is needed for dimensions not part of `spatial_dims`.
  Furthermore, `space_to_batch_nd` and `batch_to_space_nd` handle this case
  efficiently for any number of leading and trailing dimensions.

  For 0 <= i < len(spatial_dims), we assign:

    adjusted_dilation_rate[spatial_dims[i] - 1] = dilation_rate[i]
    adjusted_paddings[spatial_dims[i] - 1, :] = paddings[i, :]
    adjusted_crops[spatial_dims[i] - 1, :] = crops[i, :]

  All unassigned values of `adjusted_dilation_rate` default to 1, while all
  unassigned values of `adjusted_paddings` and `adjusted_crops` default to 0.

  Note in the case that `dilation_rate` is not uniformly 1, specifying "VALID"
  padding is equivalent to specifying `padding = "SAME"` with a filter_shape of
  `[1]*N`.

  Advanced usage. Note the following optimization: A sequence of
  `with_space_to_batch` operations with identical (not uniformly 1)
  `dilation_rate` parameters and "VALID" padding

    net = with_space_to_batch(net, dilation_rate, "VALID", op_1)
    ...
    net = with_space_to_batch(net, dilation_rate, "VALID", op_k)

  can be combined into a single `with_space_to_batch` operation as follows:

    def combined_op(converted_input, num_spatial_dims, _):
      result = op_1(converted_input, num_spatial_dims, "VALID")
      ...
      result = op_k(result, num_spatial_dims, "VALID")

    net = with_space_to_batch(net, dilation_rate, "VALID", combined_op)

  This eliminates the overhead of `k-1` calls to `space_to_batch_nd` and
  `batch_to_space_nd`.

  Similarly, a sequence of `with_space_to_batch` operations with identical (not
  uniformly 1) `dilation_rate` parameters, "SAME" padding, and odd filter
  dimensions

    net = with_space_to_batch(net, dilation_rate, "SAME", op_1, filter_shape_1)

      result = op_k(result, num_spatial_dims, "SAME")

    net = with_space_to_batch(net, dilation_rate, "VALID", combined_op)

      integers (which are >= 1) specifying the spatial dimensions of `input`
      and output.  Defaults to: `range(1, num_spatial_dims+1)`.

def atrous_conv2d(value, filters, rate, padding, name=...): # -> Any:
  """Atrous convolution (a.k.a. convolution with holes or dilated convolution).

  This function is a simpler wrapper around the more general
  `tf.nn.convolution`, and exists only for backwards compatibility. You can
  use `tf.nn.convolution` to perform 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D atrous convolution.

  Computes a 2-D atrous convolution, also known as convolution with holes or
  dilated convolution, given 4-D `value` and `filters` tensors. If the `rate`
  parameter is equal to one, it performs regular 2-D convolution. If the `rate`
  parameter is greater than one, it performs convolution with holes, sampling
  the input values every `rate` pixels in the `height` and `width` dimensions.
  This is equivalent to convolving the input with a set of upsampled filters,
  produced by inserting `rate - 1` zeros between two consecutive values of the
  filters along the `height` and `width` dimensions, hence the name atrous
  convolution or convolution with holes (the French word trous means holes in
  English).

  More specifically:

  ```
  output[batch, height, width, out_channel] =
      sum_{dheight, dwidth, in_channel} (
          filters[dheight, dwidth, in_channel, out_channel] *
          value[batch, height + rate*dheight, width + rate*dwidth, in_channel]
      )
  ```

  Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control how densely to compute
  feature responses in fully convolutional networks. Used in conjunction with
  bilinear interpolation, it offers an alternative to `conv2d_transpose` in
  dense prediction tasks such as semantic image segmentation, optical flow
  computation, or depth estimation. It also allows us to effectively enlarge
  the field of view of filters without increasing the number of parameters or
  the amount of computation.

  For a description of atrous convolution and how it can be used for dense
  feature extraction, please see: (Chen et al., 2015). The same operation is
  investigated further in (Yu et al., 2016). Previous works that effectively
  use atrous convolution in different ways are, among others,
  (Sermanet et al., 2014) and (Giusti et al., 2013).
  Atrous convolution is also closely related to the so-called noble identities
  in multi-rate signal processing.

  There are many different ways to implement atrous convolution (see the refs
  above). The implementation here reduces

  ```python
  atrous_conv2d(value, filters, rate, padding=padding)
  ```

  to the following three operations:

  ```python
  paddings = ...
  net = space_to_batch(value, paddings, block_size=rate)
  net = conv2d(net, filters, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="VALID")
  crops = ...
  net = batch_to_space(net, crops, block_size=rate)
  ```

  Advanced usage. Note the following optimization: A sequence of `atrous_conv2d`
  operations with identical `rate` parameters, 'SAME' `padding`, and filters
  with odd heights/ widths:

  ```python
  net = atrous_conv2d(net, filters1, rate, padding="SAME")
  net = atrous_conv2d(net, filters2, rate, padding="SAME")
  ...
  net = atrous_conv2d(net, filtersK, rate, padding="SAME")
  ```

  can be equivalently performed cheaper in terms of computation and memory as:

  ```python
  pad = ...  # padding so that the input dims are multiples of rate
  net = space_to_batch(net, paddings=pad, block_size=rate)
  net = conv2d(net, filters1, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
  net = conv2d(net, filters2, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
  ...
  net = conv2d(net, filtersK, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
  net = batch_to_space(net, crops=pad, block_size=rate)
  ```

  because a pair of consecutive `space_to_batch` and `batch_to_space` ops with
  the same `block_size` cancel out when their respective `paddings` and `crops`
  inputs are identical.

  Args:
    value: A 4-D `Tensor` of type `float`. It needs to be in the default "NHWC"
      format. Its shape is `[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]`.
    filters: A 4-D `Tensor` with the same type as `value` and shape
      `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`. `filters`'
      `in_channels` dimension must match that of `value`. Atrous convolution is
      equivalent to standard convolution with upsampled filters with effective
      height `filter_height + (filter_height - 1) * (rate - 1)` and effective
      width `filter_width + (filter_width - 1) * (rate - 1)`, produced by
      inserting `rate - 1` zeros along consecutive elements across the
      `filters`' spatial dimensions.
    rate: A positive int32. The stride with which we sample input values across
      the `height` and `width` dimensions. Equivalently, the rate by which we
      upsample the filter values by inserting zeros across the `height` and
      `width` dimensions. In the literature, the same parameter is sometimes
      called `input stride` or `dilation`.
    padding: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See
      [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn#notes_on_padding_2)
      for more information.
    name: Optional name for the returned tensor.

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` with the same type as `value`.
    Output shape with `'VALID'` padding is:

        [batch, height - rate * (filter_width - 1),
         width - rate * (filter_height - 1), out_channels].

    Output shape with `'SAME'` padding is:

        [batch, height, width, out_channels].

  Raises:
    ValueError: If input/output depth does not match `filters`' shape, or if
      padding is other than `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.

  This operation is sometimes called "deconvolution" after
  (Zeiler et al., 2010), but is actually the transpose (gradient) of `conv1d`
  rather than an actual deconvolution.

  Args:
    input: A 3-D `Tensor` of type `float` and shape
      `[batch, in_width, in_channels]` for `NWC` data format or
      `[batch, in_channels, in_width]` for `NCW` data format.
    filters: A 3-D `Tensor` with the same type as `input` and shape
      `[filter_width, output_channels, in_channels]`.  `filter`'s
      `in_channels` dimension must match that of `input`.
    output_shape: A 1-D `Tensor`, containing three elements, representing the
      output shape of the deconvolution op.
    strides: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1` or `3`.  The number of
      entries by which the filter is moved right at each step.
    padding: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See
      [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn#notes_on_padding_2)
      for more information.
    data_format: A string. `'NWC'` and `'NCW'` are supported.
    dilations: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1` or `3` which
      defaults to 1. The dilation factor for each dimension of input. If set to
      k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that
      dimension. Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions must be 1.
    name: Optional name for the returned tensor.

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` with the same type as `input`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If input/output depth does not match `filter`'s shape, if
      `output_shape` is not at 3-element vector, if `padding` is other than

def conv2d_v2(input, filters, strides, padding, data_format=..., dilations=..., name=...): # -> Any:
  r"""Computes a 2-D convolution given `input` and 4-D `filters` tensors.

  The `input` tensor may have rank `4` or higher, where shape dimensions `[:-3]`
  are considered batch dimensions (`batch_shape`).

  Given an input tensor of shape
  `batch_shape + [in_height, in_width, in_channels]` and a filter / kernel
  tensor of shape `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`,
  this op performs the following:

  1. Flattens the filter to a 2-D matrix with shape
     `[filter_height * filter_width * in_channels, output_channels]`.
  2. Extracts image patches from the input tensor to form a *virtual*
     tensor of shape `[batch, out_height, out_width,
     filter_height * filter_width * in_channels]`.
  3. For each patch, right-multiplies the filter matrix and the image patch
     vector.

  In detail, with the default NHWC format,

      output[b, i, j, k] =
          sum_{di, dj, q} input[b, strides[1] * i + di, strides[2] * j + dj, q] *
                          filter[di, dj, q, k]

  Must have `strides[0] = strides[3] = 1`.  For the most common case of the same
  horizontal and vertical strides, `strides = [1, stride, stride, 1]`.

  Usage Example:

  >>> x_in = np.array([[
  ...   [[2], [1], [2], [0], [1]],
  ...   [[1], [3], [2], [2], [3]],
  ...   [[1], [1], [3], [3], [0]],
  ...   [[2], [2], [0], [1], [1]],
  ...   [[0], [0], [3], [1], [2]], ]])
  >>> kernel_in = np.array([
  ...  [ [[2, 0.1]], [[3, 0.2]] ],
  ...  [ [[0, 0.3]], [[1, 0.4]] ], ])
  >>> x = tf.constant(x_in, dtype=tf.float32)
  >>> kernel = tf.constant(kernel_in, dtype=tf.float32)
  >>> tf.nn.conv2d(x, kernel, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='VALID')
  <tf.Tensor: shape=(1, 4, 4, 2), dtype=float32, numpy=..., dtype=float32)>

  Args:
    input: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types:
      `half`, `bfloat16`, `float32`, `float64`.
      A Tensor of rank at least 4. The dimension order is interpreted according
      to the value of `data_format`; with the all-but-inner-3 dimensions acting
      as batch dimensions. See below for details.
    filters: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `input`.
      A 4-D tensor of shape
      `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`
    strides: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `2` or `4`.  The
      stride of the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. If a single
      value is given it is replicated in the `H` and `W` dimension. By default
      the `N` and `C` dimensions are set to 1. The dimension order is determined
      by the value of `data_format`, see below for details.
    padding: Either the `string` `"SAME"` or `"VALID"` indicating the type of
      padding algorithm to use, or a list indicating the explicit paddings at
      the start and end of each dimension. See
      [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn#notes_on_padding_2)
      for more information. When explicit padding is used and data_format is
      `"NHWC"`, this should be in the form `[[0, 0], [pad_top, pad_bottom],
      [pad_left, pad_right], [0, 0]]`. When explicit padding used and
      data_format is `"NCHW"`, this should be in the form `[[0, 0], [0, 0],
      [pad_top, pad_bottom], [pad_left, pad_right]]`.
    data_format: An optional `string` from: `"NHWC", "NCHW"`.
      Defaults to `"NHWC"`.
      Specify the data format of the input and output data. With the
      default format "NHWC", the data is stored in the order of:
          `batch_shape + [height, width, channels]`.
      Alternatively, the format could be "NCHW", the data storage order of:
          `batch_shape + [channels, height, width]`.
    dilations: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `2` or `4`,
      defaults to 1. The dilation factor for each dimension of`input`. If a
      single value is given it is replicated in the `H` and `W` dimension. By
      default the `N` and `C` dimensions are set to 1. If set to k > 1, there
      will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension.
      The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`, see above
      for details. Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions if a 4-d tensor
      must be 1.

      `in_channels` dimension must match that of `value`. Atrous convolution is
      equivalent to standard convolution with upsampled filters with effective
      height `filter_height + (filter_height - 1) * (rate - 1)` and effective
      width `filter_width + (filter_width - 1) * (rate - 1)`, produced by

    rate: A positive int32. The stride with which we sample input values across
      the `height` and `width` dimensions. Equivalently, the rate by which we
      upsample the filter values by inserting zeros across the `height` and
      `width` dimensions. In the literature, the same parameter is sometimes
      called `input stride` or `dilation`.
    padding: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See
      [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn#notes_on_padding_2)
      for more information.
    name: Optional name for the returned tensor.

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` with the same type as `value`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If input/output depth does not match `filters`' shape, or if
      padding is other than `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`, or if the `rate` is less
      than one, or if the output_shape is not a tensor with 4 elements.

  `in_channels` convolutional filters of depth 1, `depthwise_conv2d` applies
  a different filter to each input channel (expanding from 1 channel to
  `channel_multiplier` channels for each), then concatenates the results
  together. Thus, the output has `in_channels * channel_multiplier` channels.

  """Performs max pooling on the input.

  For a given window of `ksize`, takes the maximum value within that window.
  Used for reducing computation and preventing overfitting.

  Consider an example of pooling with 2x2, non-overlapping windows:

  >>> matrix = tf.constant([
  ...     [0, 0, 1, 7],
  ...     [0, 2, 0, 0],
  ...     [5, 2, 0, 0],
  ...     [0, 0, 9, 8],
  ... ])
  >>> reshaped = tf.reshape(matrix, (1, 4, 4, 1))
  >>> tf.nn.max_pool(reshaped, ksize=2, strides=2, padding="SAME")
  <tf.Tensor: shape=(1, 2, 2, 1), dtype=int32, numpy=
  array([[[[2],
           [7]],
          [[5],
           [9]]]], dtype=int32)>

  We can adjust the window size using the `ksize` parameter. For example, if we
  were to expand the window to 3:

  >>> tf.nn.max_pool(reshaped, ksize=3, strides=2, padding="SAME")
  <tf.Tensor: shape=(1, 2, 2, 1), dtype=int32, numpy=
  array([[[[5],
           [7]],
          [[9],
           [9]]]], dtype=int32)>

  We've now picked up two additional large numbers (5 and 9) in two of the
  pooled spots.

  Note that our windows are now overlapping, since we're still moving by 2 units
  on each iteration. This is causing us to see the same 9 repeated twice, since
  it is part of two overlapping windows.

  We can adjust how far we move our window with each iteration using the
  `strides` parameter. Updating this to the same value as our window size
  eliminates the overlap:

  >>> tf.nn.max_pool(reshaped, ksize=3, strides=3, padding="SAME")
  <tf.Tensor: shape=(1, 2, 2, 1), dtype=int32, numpy=
  array([[[[2],
           [7]],
          [[5],
           [9]]]], dtype=int32)>

  Because the window does not neatly fit into our input, padding is added around
  the edges, giving us the same result as when we used a 2x2 window. We can skip
  padding altogether and simply drop the windows that do not fully fit into our
  input by instead passing `"VALID"` to the `padding` argument:

  >>> tf.nn.max_pool(reshaped, ksize=3, strides=3, padding="VALID")
  <tf.Tensor: shape=(1, 1, 1, 1), dtype=int32, numpy=array([[[[5]]]],
   dtype=int32)>

  Now we've grabbed the largest value in the 3x3 window starting from the upper-
  left corner. Since no other windows fit in our input, they are dropped.

    input:  Tensor of rank N+2, of shape `[batch_size] + input_spatial_shape +

  Downsamples the input images along theirs spatial dimensions (height and

  The window is shifted by `strides` along each dimension.

  for a detailed description of the various RNG systems in TF. As the

  Please see `tf.nn.experimental.stateless_dropout` for an overview
  of dropout.

  Unlike `tf.nn.experimental.stateless_dropout`, here you can supply a
  custom sampler function `uniform_sampler` that (given a shape and a
  dtype) generates a random, `Uniform[0, 1)`-distributed tensor (of
  that shape and dtype).  `uniform_sampler` can be
  e.g. `tf.random.stateless_random_uniform` or
  `tf.random.Generator.uniform`.

  For example, if you are using `tf.random.Generator` to generate
  random numbers, you can use this code to do dropouts:

  >>> g = tf.random.Generator.from_seed(7)
  >>> sampler = g.uniform

  r"""Performs fractional max pooling on the input.

  This is a deprecated version of `fractional_max_pool`.

  Fractional max pooling is slightly different than regular max pooling.  In
  regular max pooling, you downsize an input set by taking the maximum value of
  smaller N x N subsections of the set (often 2x2), and try to reduce the set by
  a factor of N, where N is an integer.  Fractional max pooling, as you might
  expect from the word "fractional", means that the overall reduction ratio N
  does not have to be an integer.

  The sizes of the pooling regions are generated randomly but are fairly
  uniform.  For example, let's look at the height dimension, and the constraints
  on the list of rows that will be pool boundaries.

  First we define the following:

  1.  input_row_length : the number of rows from the input set
  2.  output_row_length : which will be smaller than the input
  3.  alpha = input_row_length / output_row_length : our reduction ratio
  4.  K = floor(alpha)
  5.  row_pooling_sequence : this is the result list of pool boundary rows

  Then, row_pooling_sequence should satisfy:

  1.  a[0] = 0 : the first value of the sequence is 0
  2.  a[end] = input_row_length : the last value of the sequence is the size
  3.  K <= (a[i+1] - a[i]) <= K+1 : all intervals are K or K+1 size
  4.  length(row_pooling_sequence) = output_row_length+1

  Args:
    value: A `Tensor`. 4-D with shape `[batch, height, width, channels]`.
    pooling_ratio: A list of `floats` that has length >= 4.  Pooling ratio for
      each dimension of `value`, currently only supports row and col dimension
      and should be >= 1.0. For example, a valid pooling ratio looks like [1.0,
      1.44, 1.73, 1.0]. The first and last elements must be 1.0 because we don't
      allow pooling on batch and channels dimensions.  1.44 and 1.73 are pooling
      ratio on height and width dimensions respectively.

def fractional_max_pool_v2(value, pooling_ratio, pseudo_random=..., overlapping=..., seed=..., name=...): # -> FractionalMaxPool:
  r"""Performs fractional max pooling on the input.

  Fractional max pooling is slightly different than regular max pooling.  In
  regular max pooling, you downsize an input set by taking the maximum value of
  smaller N x N subsections of the set (often 2x2), and try to reduce the set by
  a factor of N, where N is an integer.  Fractional max pooling, as you might
  expect from the word "fractional", means that the overall reduction ratio N
  does not have to be an integer.

  The sizes of the pooling regions are generated randomly but are fairly
  uniform.  For example, let's look at the height dimension, and the constraints
  on the list of rows that will be pool boundaries.

  First we define the following:

  1.  input_row_length : the number of rows from the input set
  2.  output_row_length : which will be smaller than the input
  3.  alpha = input_row_length / output_row_length : our reduction ratio
  4.  K = floor(alpha)
  5.  row_pooling_sequence : this is the result list of pool boundary rows

  Then, row_pooling_sequence should satisfy:

  1.  a[0] = 0 : the first value of the sequence is 0
  2.  a[end] = input_row_length : the last value of the sequence is the size
  3.  K <= (a[i+1] - a[i]) <= K+1 : all intervals are K or K+1 size
  4.  length(row_pooling_sequence) = output_row_length+1

  Args:
    value: A `Tensor`. 4-D with shape `[batch, height, width, channels]`.
    pooling_ratio: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `2` or `4`.
      Pooling ratio for each dimension of `value`, currently only supports row
      and col dimension and should be >= 1.0. For example, a valid pooling ratio
      looks like [1.0, 1.44, 1.73, 1.0]. The first and last elements must be 1.0
      because we don't allow pooling on batch and channels dimensions.  1.44 and
      1.73 are pooling ratio on height and width dimensions respectively.
    pseudo_random: An optional `bool`.  Defaults to `False`. When set to `True`,
      generates the pooling sequence in a pseudorandom fashion, otherwise, in a
      random fashion. Check paper (Graham, 2015) for difference between
