  Note that the shape and dtype arguments appear redundant since they
  should be obtainable from t.  The are two reasons for including
  them.  First, the shape and type of tensors passed via broadcast must
  be known ahead of time in their most specific form so that the receive
  side can allocate memory for the operation and shape/type inference can
  carry forward from there.  Including the same declarations on the
  send side clarifies a commitment already made.  Secondly, having nearly
  identical use syntax for send and receive sides may simplify tool-driven
  generation of broadcast.
