  Args:
    x: The first argument of a broadcasting binary op.
    y: The second argument of a broadcasting binary op.
    grad: Deprecated.

  Returns:
    A pair of triples, one per argument with

      * Reduction axes for the argument (list or tensor);
      * Boolean indicating whether the reduction must be applied.
