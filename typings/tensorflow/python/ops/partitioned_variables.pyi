"""Helper functions for creating partitioned variables.

This is a convenient abstraction to partition a large variable across
multiple smaller variables that can be assigned to different devices.

The full variable can be reconstructed by concatenating the smaller variables.
Using partitioned variables instead of a single variable is mostly a
performance choice.  It however also has an impact on:

1. Random initialization, as the random number generator is called once per
   slice
2. Updates, as they happen in parallel across slices

A key design goal is to allow a different graph to repartition a variable
with the same name but different slicings, including possibly no partitions.

TODO(touts): If an initializer provides a seed, the seed must be changed
deterministically for each slice, maybe by adding one to it, otherwise each
slice will use the same values.  Maybe this can be done by passing the
slice offsets to the initializer functions.

Typical usage:

```python
# Create a list of partitioned variables with:
vs = create_partitioned_variables(
    <shape>, <slicing>, <initializer>, name=<optional-name>)

# Pass the list as inputs to embedding_lookup for sharded, parallel lookup:
y = embedding_lookup(vs, ids, partition_strategy="div")

# Or fetch the variables in parallel to speed up large matmuls:
z = matmul(x, concat(slice_dim, vs))
```

  """Get a partitioner for VariableScope to keep shards below `max_shard_bytes`.

  This partitioner will shard a Variable along one axis, attempting to keep
  the maximum shard size below `max_shard_bytes`.  In practice, this is not
  always possible when sharding along only one axis.  When this happens,
  this axis is sharded as much as possible (i.e., every dimension becomes
  a separate shard).

  If the partitioner hits the `max_shards` limit, then each shard may end up
  larger than `max_shard_bytes`. By default `max_shards` equals `None` and no
  limit on the number of shards is enforced.

  One reasonable value for `max_shard_bytes` is `(64 << 20) - 1`, or almost
  `64MB`, to keep below the protobuf byte limit.

  Args:
    max_shard_bytes: The maximum size any given shard is allowed to be.
    axis: The axis to partition along.  Default: outermost axis.
    bytes_per_string_element: If the `Variable` is of type string, this provides
      an estimate of how large each scalar in the `Variable` is.
    max_shards: The maximum number of shards in int created taking precedence
      over `max_shard_bytes`.

  Returns:
    A partition function usable as the `partitioner` argument to
    `variable_scope` and `get_variable`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If any of the byte counts are non-positive.

  @compatibility(TF2)
  This API is deprecated in TF2. In TF2, partitioner is no longer part of
  the variable declaration via `tf.Variable`.
  [ParameterServer Training]
  (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/parameter_server_training)
  handles partitioning of variables. The corresponding TF2 partitioner class of
  `fixed_size_partitioner` is
  `tf.distribute.experimental.partitioners.FixedShardsPartitioner`.

  Check the [migration guide]
  (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate#2_use_python_objects_to_track_variables_and_losses)
  on the differences in treatment of variables and losses between TF1 and TF2.

  Before:

    ```
    x = tf.compat.v1.get_variable(
      "x", shape=(2,), partitioner=tf.compat.v1.fixed_size_partitioner(2)
    )
    ```
  After:

    ```
    partitioner = (
        tf.distribute.experimental.partitioners.FixedShardsPartitioner(
            num_shards=2)

  """Create a list of partitioned variables according to the given `slicing`.

  Currently only one dimension of the full variable can be sliced, and the
  full variable can be reconstructed by the concatenation of the returned
  list along that dimension.

  Args:
    shape: List of integers.  The shape of the full variable.
    slicing: List of integers.  How to partition the variable.
      Must be of the same length as `shape`.  Each value
      indicate how many slices to create in the corresponding
      dimension.  Presently only one of the values can be more than 1;
      that is, the variable can only be sliced along one dimension.

      For convenience, The requested number of partitions does not have to
      divide the corresponding dimension evenly.  If it does not, the
      shapes of the partitions are incremented by 1 starting from partition
      0 until all slack is absorbed.  The adjustment rules may change in the
      future, but as you can save/restore these variables with different
      slicing specifications this should not be a problem.
    initializer: A `Tensor` of shape `shape` or a variable initializer
      function.  If a function, it will be called once for each slice,
      passing the shape and data type of the slice as parameters.  The
      function must return a tensor with the same shape as the slice.
    dtype: Type of the variables. Ignored if `initializer` is a `Tensor`.
    trainable: If True also add all the variables to the graph collection
      `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`.
    collections: List of graph collections keys to add the variables to.
      Defaults to `[GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES]`.
    name: Optional name for the full variable.  Defaults to
      `"PartitionedVariable"` and gets uniquified automatically.
    reuse: Boolean or `None`; if `True` and name is set, it would reuse
      previously created variables. if `False` it will create new variables.
      if `None`, it would inherit the parent scope reuse.

  Returns:
    A list of Variables corresponding to the slicing.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If any of the arguments is malformed.
