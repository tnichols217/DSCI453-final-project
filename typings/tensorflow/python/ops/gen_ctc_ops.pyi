  r"""Performs beam search decoding on the logits given in input.

  A note about the attribute merge_repeated: For the beam search decoder,
  this means that if consecutive entries in a beam are the same, only
  the first of these is emitted.  That is, when the top path is "A B B B B",
  "A B" is returned if merge_repeated = True but "A B B B B" is
  returned if merge_repeated = False.

  Args:
    inputs: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`.
      3-D, shape: `(max_time x batch_size x num_classes)`, the logits.
    sequence_length: A `Tensor` of type `int32`.
      A vector containing sequence lengths, size `(batch)`.
    beam_width: An `int` that is `>= 1`.
      A scalar >= 0 (beam search beam width).
    top_paths: An `int` that is `>= 1`.
      A scalar >= 0, <= beam_width (controls output size).
    merge_repeated: An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`.
      If true, merge repeated classes in output.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A tuple of `Tensor` objects (decoded_indices, decoded_values, decoded_shape, log_probability).

    decoded_indices: A list of `top_paths` `Tensor` objects with type `int64`.
    decoded_values: A list of `top_paths` `Tensor` objects with type `int64`.
    decoded_shape: A list of `top_paths` `Tensor` objects with type `int64`.

  r"""Performs greedy decoding on the logits given in inputs.

  A note about the attribute merge_repeated: if enabled, when
  consecutive logits' maximum indices are the same, only the first of
  these is emitted.  Labeling the blank '*', the sequence "A B B * B B"
  becomes "A B B" if merge_repeated = True and "A B B B B" if
  merge_repeated = False.

  Regardless of the value of merge_repeated, if the maximum index of a given
  time and batch corresponds to the blank, index `(num_classes - 1)`, no new
  element is emitted.
