def index_shuffle(index, seed, max_index): # -> Any:
  """Outputs the position of `index` in a permutation of `[0, ..., max_index]`.

  For each possible `seed` and `max_index` there is one pseudorandom
  permutation of the sequence `S=[0, ..., max_index]`. Instead of
  materializing the full array we can compute the new position of any
  integer `i` (`0 <= i <= max_index`) in `S`. This can be useful for
  very large `max_index`s by avoiding allocating large chunks of
  memory.

  In the simplest case, `index` and `max_index` are scalars, and
  `seed` is a length-2 vector (as typical for stateless RNGs). But
  you can add a leading batch dimension to all of them. If some of
  them don't have the batch dimension while others do, `index_shuffle`
  will add a batch dimension to the former by broadcasting.

  The input `index` and output can be used as indices to shuffle a
  vector.  For example:

  >>> vector = tf.constant(['e0', 'e1', 'e2', 'e3'])
  >>> indices = tf.random.experimental.index_shuffle(
  ...   index=tf.range(4), seed=[5, 9], max_index=3)

  >>> shuffled_vector = tf.gather(vector, indices)
  >>> print(shuffled_vector)
  tf.Tensor([b'e2' b'e0' b'e1' b'e3'], shape=(4,), dtype=string)

  More usefully, it can be used in a streaming (aka online) scenario such as
  `tf.data`, where each element of `vector` is processed individually and the
  whole `vector` is never materialized in memory.

  >>> dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(10)
  >>> dataset = dataset.map(
  ...  lambda idx: tf.random.experimental.index_shuffle(idx, [5, 8], 9))
  >>> [a.item() for a in dataset.as_numpy_iterator()]
  [3, 8, 0, 1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 4, 5]

  This operation is stateless (like the `tf.random.stateless_*`
  functions), meaning the output is fully determined by the `seed`
  (other inputs being equal).  Each `seed` choice corresponds to one
  permutation, so when calling this function multiple times for the
  same shuffling, please make sure to use the same `seed`. For
  example:

  >>> seed = [5, 9]
  >>> idx0 = tf.random.experimental.index_shuffle(0, seed, 3)
  >>> idx1 = tf.random.experimental.index_shuffle(1, seed, 3)
  >>> idx2 = tf.random.experimental.index_shuffle(2, seed, 3)

  >>> shuffled_vector = tf.gather(vector, [idx0, idx1, idx2, idx3])
  >>> print(shuffled_vector)
  tf.Tensor([b'e2' b'e0' b'e1' b'e3'], shape=(4,), dtype=string)

  Args:
    index: An integer scalar tensor or vector with values in `[0, max_index]`.
      It can be seen as either a value `v` in the sequence `S=[0, ...,
      max_index]` to be permutated, or as an index of an element `e` in a
      shuffled vector.
    seed: A tensor of shape [2] or [n, 2] with dtype `int32`, `uint32`, `int64`
      or `uint64`.  The RNG seed. If the rank is unknown during graph-building
      time it must be 1 at runtime.
    max_index: A non-negative tensor with the same shape and dtype as `index`.
      The upper bound (inclusive).

  Returns:
    If all inputs were scalar (shape [2] for `seed`), the output will
    be a scalar with the same dtype as `index`. The output can be seen
    as the new position of `v` in `S`, or as the index of `e` in the
    vector before shuffling.  If one or multiple inputs were vectors
    (shape [n, 2] for `seed`), then the output will be a vector of the

  For floats, the default range is `[0, 1)`.  For ints, at least `maxval` must

  Note: Because internal calculations are done using `float64` and casting has
  `floor` semantics, we must manually map zero outcomes to the smallest
  possible positive floating-point value, i.e., `np.finfo(dtype).tiny`.  This
  means that `np.finfo(dtype).tiny` occurs more frequently than it otherwise
  should.  This bias can only happen for small values of `alpha`, i.e.,
  `alpha << 1` or large values of `beta`, i.e., `beta >> 1`.

def stateless_categorical(logits, num_samples, seed, dtype=..., name=...): # -> Any:
  """Draws deterministic pseudorandom samples from a categorical distribution.

  This is a stateless version of `tf.categorical`: if run twice with the
  same seeds and shapes, it will produce the same pseudorandom numbers.  The
  output is consistent across multiple runs on the same hardware (and between
  CPU and GPU), but may change between versions of TensorFlow or on non-CPU/GPU
  hardware.


  Example:

  ```python
  # samples has shape [1, 5], where each value is either 0 or 1 with equal
  # probability.
  samples = tf.random.stateless_categorical(
      tf.math.log([[0.5, 0.5]]), 5, seed=[7, 17])
  ```

  Args:
    logits: 2-D Tensor with shape `[batch_size, num_classes]`.  Each slice `[i,
      :]` represents the unnormalized log-probabilities for all classes.
    num_samples: 0-D.  Number of independent samples to draw for each row slice.
    seed: A shape [2] Tensor, the seed to the random number generator. Must have
      dtype `int32` or `int64`. (When using XLA, only `int32` is allowed.)
    dtype: The integer type of the output: `int32` or `int64`. Defaults to
      `int64`.
    name: Optional name for the operation.

  Returns:
    The drawn samples of shape `[batch_size, num_samples]`.

  The generated values follow a normal distribution with specified mean and

  Args:
    shape: A 1-D integer `Tensor` or Python array. The shape of the output

    seed: A shape [2] Tensor, the seed to the random number generator. Must have
      dtype `int32` or `int64`. (When using XLA, only `int32` is allowed.)
    means: A `Tensor` or Python value of type `dtype`. The mean of the truncated
      normal distribution. This must broadcast with `stddevs`, `minvals` and
      `maxvals`, and the broadcasted shape must be dominated by `shape`.
    stddevs: A `Tensor` or Python value of type `dtype`. The standard deviation
      of the truncated normal distribution. This must broadcast with `means`,
      `minvals` and `maxvals`, and the broadcasted shape must be dominated by
      `shape`.
    minvals: A `Tensor` or Python value of type `dtype`. The minimum value of
      the truncated normal distribution. This must broadcast with `means`,
      `stddevs` and `maxvals`, and the broadcasted shape must be dominated by
      `shape`.
    maxvals: A `Tensor` or Python value of type `dtype`. The maximum value of
      the truncated normal distribution. This must broadcast with `means`,
      `stddevs` and `minvals`, and the broadcasted shape must be dominated by
      `shape`.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A tensor of the specified shape filled with random truncated normal values.
