  """Given an arbitrary function, wrap it so that it does variable sharing.

  @compatibility(TF2)
  `tf.compat.v1.make_template` is a legacy API that is only compatible
  with eager execution enabled and `tf.function` if you combine it with
  `tf.compat.v1.keras.utils.track_tf1_style_variables`. See the model mapping
  migration guide section on `make_template` for more info:

  https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate/model_mapping#using_tfcompatv1make_template_in_the_decorated_method

  Even if you use legacy apis for `variable_scope`-based variable reuse,
  we recommend using
  `tf.compat.v1.keras.utils.track_tf1_style_variables` directly and not using
  `tf.compat.v1.make_template`, as it interoperates with eager execution in a
  simpler and more predictable fashion than `make_template`.

  The TF2 API approach would be tracking your variables using
  `tf.Module`s or Keras layers and models rather than relying on
  `make_template`.
  @end_compatibility

  This wraps `func_` in a Template and partially evaluates it. Templates are
  functions that create variables the first time they are called and reuse them
  thereafter. In order for `func_` to be compatible with a `Template` it must
  have the following properties:

  * The function should create all trainable variables and any variables that
     should be reused by calling `tf.compat.v1.get_variable`. If a trainable
     variable is
     created using `tf.Variable`, then a ValueError will be thrown. Variables
     that are intended to be locals can be created by specifying
     `tf.Variable(..., trainable=false)`.
  * The function may use variable scopes and other templates internally to
      create and reuse variables, but it shouldn't use
      `tf.compat.v1.global_variables` to
      capture variables that are defined outside of the scope of the function.
  * Internal scopes and variable names should not depend on any arguments that
      are not supplied to `make_template`. In general you will get a ValueError
      telling you that you are trying to reuse a variable that doesn't exist
      if you make a mistake.

  In the following example, both `z` and `w` will be scaled by the same `y`. It
  is important to note that if we didn't assign `scalar_name` and used a
  different name for z and w that a `ValueError` would be thrown because it
  couldn't reuse the variable.

  ```python
  def my_op(x, scalar_name):
    var1 = tf.compat.v1.get_variable(scalar_name,
                           shape=[],
                           initializer=tf.compat.v1.constant_initializer(1))
    return x * var1

  scale_by_y = tf.compat.v1.make_template('scale_by_y', my_op, scalar_name='y')

  z = scale_by_y(input1)
  w = scale_by_y(input2)
  ```

  As a safe-guard, the returned function will raise a `ValueError` after the
  first call if trainable variables are created by calling `tf.Variable`.

  If all of these are true, then 2 properties are enforced by the template:

  1. Calling the same template multiple times will share all non-local
      variables.
  2. Two different templates are guaranteed to be unique, unless you reenter the
      same variable scope as the initial definition of a template and redefine
      it. An examples of this exception:

  ```python
  def my_op(x, scalar_name):
    var1 = tf.compat.v1.get_variable(scalar_name,
                           shape=[],
                           initializer=tf.compat.v1.constant_initializer(1))
    return x * var1

  with tf.compat.v1.variable_scope('scope') as vs:
    scale_by_y = tf.compat.v1.make_template('scale_by_y', my_op,
    scalar_name='y')
    z = scale_by_y(input1)
    w = scale_by_y(input2)

  # Creates a template that reuses the variables above.
  with tf.compat.v1.variable_scope(vs, reuse=True):
    scale_by_y2 = tf.compat.v1.make_template('scale_by_y', my_op,
    scalar_name='y')
    z2 = scale_by_y2(input1)
    w2 = scale_by_y2(input2)
  ```

  Depending on the value of `create_scope_now_`, the full variable scope may be
  captured either at the time of first call or at the time of construction. If
  this option is set to True, then all Tensors created by repeated calls to the
  template will have an extra trailing _N+1 to their name, as the first time the
  scope is entered in the Template constructor no Tensors are created.

  Note: `name_`, `func_` and `create_scope_now_` have a trailing underscore to
  reduce the likelihood of collisions with kwargs.

  Args:
    name_: A name for the scope created by this template. If necessary, the name
      will be made unique by appending `_N` to the name.
    func_: The function to wrap.
    create_scope_now_: Boolean controlling whether the scope should be created
      when the template is constructed or when the template is called. Default
      is False, meaning the scope is created when the template is called.
    unique_name_: When used, it overrides name_ and is not made unique. If a
      template of the same scope/unique_name already exists and reuse is false,
      an error is raised. Defaults to None.
    custom_getter_: Optional custom getter for variables used in `func_`. See
      the `tf.compat.v1.get_variable` `custom_getter` documentation for more
      information.
    **kwargs: Keyword arguments to apply to `func_`.

  Returns:
    A function to encapsulate a set of variables which should be created once
    and reused. An enclosing scope will be created either when `make_template`
    is called or when the result is called, depending on the value of
    `create_scope_now_`. Regardless of the value, the first time the template
    is called it will enter the scope with no reuse, and call `func_` to create
    variables, which are guaranteed to be unique. All subsequent calls will
    re-enter the scope and reuse those variables.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if `name_` is None.

        is enabled, enabling this flag gives the caller access to graph-function
