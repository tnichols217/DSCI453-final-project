  r"""Batches all input tensors nondeterministically.

  When many instances of this Op are being run concurrently with the same
  container/shared_name in the same device, some will output zero-shaped Tensors
  and others will output Tensors of size up to max_batch_size.

  All Tensors in in_tensors are batched together (so, for example, labels and
  features should be batched with a single instance of this operation.

  Each invocation of batch emits an `id` scalar which will be used to identify
  this particular invocation when doing unbatch or its gradient.

  Each op which emits a non-empty batch will also emit a non-empty batch_index
  Tensor, which, is a [K, 3] matrix where each row contains the invocation's id,
  start, and length of elements of each set of Tensors present in batched_tensors.

  Batched tensors are concatenated along the first dimension, and all tensors in
  in_tensors must have the first dimension of the same size.

  in_tensors: The tensors to be batched.
  num_batch_threads: Number of scheduling threads for processing batches of work.
   Determines the number of batches processed in parallel.
  max_batch_size: Batch sizes will never be bigger than this.
  batch_timeout_micros: Maximum number of microseconds to wait before outputting
   an incomplete batch.
  allowed_batch_sizes: Optional list of allowed batch sizes. If left empty, does
   nothing. Otherwise, supplies a list of batch sizes, causing the op to pad
   batches up to one of those sizes. The entries must increase monotonically, and
   the final entry must equal max_batch_size.
  grad_timeout_micros: The timeout to use for the gradient. See Unbatch.
  batched_tensors: Either empty tensors or a batch of concatenated Tensors.
  batch_index: If out_tensors is non-empty, has information to invert it.
  container: Controls the scope of sharing of this batch.
  id: always contains a scalar with a unique ID for this invocation of Batch.
  shared_name: Concurrently running instances of batch in the same device with the
   same container and shared_name will batch their elements together. If left
   empty, the op name will be used as the shared name.
  T: the types of tensors to be batched.

  Args:
    in_tensors: A list of `Tensor` objects.
    num_batch_threads: An `int`.
    max_batch_size: An `int`.
    batch_timeout_micros: An `int`.
    grad_timeout_micros: An `int`.
    max_enqueued_batches: An optional `int`. Defaults to `10`.
    allowed_batch_sizes: An optional list of `ints`. Defaults to `[]`.
    container: An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`.
    shared_name: An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`.
    batching_queue: An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A tuple of `Tensor` objects (batched_tensors, batch_index, id).

    batched_tensors: A list of `Tensor` objects. Has the same type as `in_tensors`.

  r"""Batches all the inputs tensors to the computation done by the function.

  So, for example, in the following code

    ```python

    # This input will be captured.
    y = tf.placeholder_with_default(1.0, shape=[])

    @tf.Defun(tf.float32)
    def computation(a):
      return tf.matmul(a, a) + y

            allowed_batch_sizes=[3, 10],
            batching_queue="")
    ```

  If more than one session.run call is simultaneously trying to compute `b`
  the values of `a` will be gathered, non-deterministically concatenated
  along the first axis, and only one thread will run the computation.

  Assumes that all arguments of the function are Tensors which will be batched
  along their first dimension.

  Arguments that are captured, are not batched. The session.run call which does
  the concatenation, will use the values of the captured tensors available to it.
  Therefore, typical uses of captured tensors should involve values which remain
  unchanged across session.run calls. Inference is a good example of this.

  SparseTensor is not supported. The return value of the decorated function
  must be a Tensor or a list/tuple of Tensors.

  Args:
    in_tensors: A list of `Tensor` objects. The tensors to be batched.
    captured_tensors: A list of `Tensor` objects.
      The tensors which are captured in the function, and don't need
      to be batched.
    f: A function decorated with @Defun.
    num_batch_threads: An `int`.
      Number of scheduling threads for processing batches of work.
      Determines the number of batches processed in parallel.
    max_batch_size: An `int`. Batch sizes will never be bigger than this.
    batch_timeout_micros: An `int`.
      Maximum number of microseconds to wait before outputting
      an incomplete batch.
    Tout: A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`.
      the types of the output tensors.
    max_enqueued_batches: An optional `int`. Defaults to `10`.
      Maximum number of batches enqueued. Default: 10.
    allowed_batch_sizes: An optional list of `ints`. Defaults to `[]`.
      Optional list of allowed batch sizes. If left empty, does
      nothing. Otherwise, supplies a list of batch sizes, causing the op to pad
      batches up to one of those sizes. The entries must increase monotonically.
      If enable_large_batch_splitting is false (i.e., large-input-split is not
      enabled) the final entry must equal max_batch_size.
    container: An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`.
      Controls the scope of sharing of this batch.
    shared_name: An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`.
      Concurrently running instances of batch in the same device with the
      same container and shared_name will batch their elements together. If left
      empty, the op name will be used as the shared name.
    batching_queue: An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`.
    low_priority_max_batch_size: An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`.
    low_priority_batch_timeout_micros: An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`.

    batch_padding_policy: An optional `string` from: `"PAD_UP", "BATCH_DOWN", "MINIMIZE_TPU_COST_PER_REQUEST"`. Defaults to `"PAD_UP"`.
    enable_large_batch_splitting: An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`.
      input with a large size (i.e., larger than the largest value of
      `allowed_batch_sizes`) will be splitted into multiple batches with batch size.
