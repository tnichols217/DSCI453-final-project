"""Utility to convert a Graph to a FunctionDef."""
def graph_to_function_def(graph, operations, inputs, outputs, out_names=...):
  """Returns `graph` as a `FunctionDef` protocol buffer.

  This method creates a [`FunctionDef`](
  https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/framework/function.proto)
  protocol buffer that contains all the ops in `operations`.  The
  operations become the body of the function.

  The arguments `inputs` and `outputs` will be listed as the inputs
  and outputs tensors of the function.  They must be lists of
  tensors present in the graph.  The lists can optionally be empty.

  Args:
    graph: Graph.
    operations: the operations to put in the function. Must be a subset of
     the operations in the graph.
    inputs: List of tensors. Inputs to the function.
    outputs: List of tensors. Outputs of the function.
    out_names: Optional list of string names for the outputs.

  Returns:
    A FunctionDef protocol buffer.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if out_names is specified and the wrong length.
