  This can be used to merge partial specifications of devices. The

    Often a device merge is invoked in order to generate a string which can be
    passed into the c api. In such a case, we can cache the
      node_def.device  ->  merge_result_string

    map, and in most cases avoid:
      - Materializing a copy of self._spec (In the case of DeviceSpecV1)
      - Materializing a DeviceSpec for node_def.device
      - A DeviceSpec.merge_from invocation

    In practice the cache hit rate for this function is very high, because the
    number of invocations when iterating through the device stack is much
    larger than the number of devices.

    Args:
      node_def: An Operation (or Operation-like) to merge device constraints
        with self._spec
