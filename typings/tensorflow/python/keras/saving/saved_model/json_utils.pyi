These are required to retain the original format of the build input shape, since
layers and models may have different build behaviors depending on if the shape
is a list, tuple, or TensorShape. For example, Network.build() will create
separate inputs if the given input_shape is a list, and will create a single
input if the given shape is a tuple.
