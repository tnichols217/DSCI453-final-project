"""Contains the Policy class for mixed precision training."""
class Policy:
  """A dtype policy for a Keras layer.

  A dtype policy determines a layer's computation and variable dtypes. Each
  layer has a policy. Policies can be passed to the `dtype` argument of layer
  constructors, or a global policy can be set with
  `tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy`.

  Args:
    name: The policy name, which determines the compute and variable dtypes. Can
      be any dtype name, such as `'float32'` or `'float64'`, which causes both
      the compute and variable dtypes will be that dtype. Can also be the string
      `'mixed_float16'` or `'mixed_bfloat16'`, which causes the compute dtype to
      be float16 or bfloat16 and the variable dtype to be float32.

  Typically you only need to interact with dtype policies when using mixed
  precision, which is the use of float16 or bfloat16 for computations and
  float32 for variables. This is why the term `mixed_precision` appears in the
  API name. Mixed precision can be enabled by passing `'mixed_float16'` or
  `'mixed_bfloat16'` to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy`. See [the
  mixed precision guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/mixed_precision)
  for more information on how to use mixed precision.

  >>> tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy('mixed_float16')
  >>> layer1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
  >>> layer1.dtype_policy  # `layer1` will automatically use mixed precision
  <Policy "mixed_float16">
  >>> # Can optionally override layer to use float32 instead of mixed precision.
  >>> layer2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, dtype='float32')
  >>> layer2.dtype_policy
  <Policy "float32">
  >>> # Set policy back to initial float32 for future examples.
  >>> tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy('float32')

  In the example above, passing `dtype='float32'` to the layer is equivalent to
  passing `dtype=tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy('float32')`. In general,
  passing a dtype policy name to a layer is equivalent to passing the
  corresponding policy, so it is never necessary to explicitly construct a
  `Policy` object.

  Note: `Model.compile` will automatically wrap an optimizer with a
  `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer` if you use the `'mixed_float16'`
  policy. If you use a custom training loop instead of calling `Model.compile`,
  you should explicitly use a `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer` to
  avoid numeric underflow with float16.

  ### How a layer uses its policy's compute dtype

  A layer casts its inputs to its compute dtype. This causes the layer's
  computations and output to also be in the compute dtype. For example:

  >>> x = tf.ones((4, 4, 4, 4), dtype='float64')
  >>> # `layer`'s policy defaults to float32.
  >>> layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=4, kernel_size=2)
  >>> layer.compute_dtype  # Equivalent to layer.dtype_policy.compute_dtype
  'float32'
  >>> # `layer` casts its inputs to its compute dtype and does computations in
  >>> # that dtype.
  >>> y = layer(x)
  >>> y.dtype
  tf.float32

  Note that the base `tf.keras.layers.Layer` class inserts the casts. If
  subclassing your own layer, you do not have to insert any casts.

  Currently, only tensors in the first argument to the layer's `call` method are
  casted (although this will likely be changed in a future minor release). For
  example:

  >>> class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  ...   # Bug! `b` will not be casted.
  ...   def call(self, a, b):
  ...     return a + 1., b + 1.
  >>> a = tf.constant(1., dtype="float32")
  >>> b = tf.constant(1., dtype="float32")
  >>> layer = MyLayer(dtype="float64")
  >>> x, y = layer(a, b)
  >>> x.dtype
  tf.float64
  >>> y.dtype
  tf.float32

  If writing your own layer with multiple inputs, you should either explicitly
  cast other tensors to `self.compute_dtype` in `call` or accept all tensors in
  the first argument as a list.

  The casting only occurs in TensorFlow 2. If
  `tf.compat.v1.disable_v2_behavior()` has been called, you can enable the
  casting behavior with `tf.compat.v1.keras.layers.enable_v2_dtype_behavior()`.

  ### How a layer uses its policy's variable dtype

  The default dtype of variables created by `tf.keras.layers.Layer.add_weight`
  is the layer's policy's variable dtype.

  If a layer's compute and variable dtypes differ, `add_weight` will wrap
  floating-point variables with a special wrapper called an `AutoCastVariable`.
  `AutoCastVariable` is identical to the original variable except it casts
  itself to the layer's compute dtype when used within `Layer.call`. This means
  if you are writing a layer, you do not have to explicitly cast the variables
  to the layer's compute dtype. For example:

  >>> class SimpleDense(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  ...
  ...   def build(self, input_shape):
  ...     # With mixed precision, self.kernel is a float32 AutoCastVariable
  ...     self.kernel = self.add_weight('kernel', (input_shape[-1], 10))
  ...
  ...   def call(self, inputs):
  ...     # With mixed precision, self.kernel will be casted to float16
  ...     return tf.linalg.matmul(inputs, self.kernel)
  ...
  >>> layer = SimpleDense(dtype='mixed_float16')
  >>> y = layer(tf.ones((10, 10)))
  >>> y.dtype
  tf.float16
  >>> layer.kernel.dtype
  tf.float32

  A layer author can prevent a variable from being wrapped with an
  `AutoCastVariable` by passing `experimental_autocast=False` to `add_weight`,
  which is useful if the float32 value of the variable must be accessed within
  the layer.

  ### How to write a layer that supports mixed precision and float64.

  For the most part, layers will automatically support mixed precision and
  float64 without any additional work, due to the fact the base layer
  automatically casts inputs, creates variables of the correct type, and in the
  case of mixed precision, wraps variables with `AutoCastVariables`.

  The primary case where you need extra work to support mixed precision or
  float64 is when you create a new tensor, such as with `tf.ones` or
  `tf.random.normal`, In such cases, you must create the tensor of the correct
  dtype. For example, if you call `tf.random.normal`, you must pass the compute
  dtype, which is the dtype the inputs have been casted to:

  >>> class AddRandom(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  ...
  ...   def call(self, inputs):
  ...     # We must pass `dtype=inputs.dtype`, otherwise a TypeError may
  ...     # occur when adding `inputs` to `rand`.
  ...     rand = tf.random.normal(shape=inputs.shape, dtype=inputs.dtype)
  ...     return inputs + rand
  >>> layer = AddRandom(dtype='mixed_float16')
  >>> y = layer(x)
  >>> y.dtype
  tf.float16

  If you did not pass `dtype=inputs.dtype` to `tf.random.normal`, a
  `TypeError` would have occurred. This is because the `tf.random.normal`'s
  dtype defaults to `"float32"`, but the input dtype is float16. You cannot add
  a float32 tensor with a float16 tensor.

    This is the dtype layers will do their computations in. Typically layers

    Note that even if the compute dtype is float16 or bfloat16, hardware devices
    may not do individual adds, multiplies, and other fundamental operations in
    float16 or bfloat16, but instead may do some of them in float32 for numeric
    stability. The compute dtype is the dtype of the inputs and outputs of the
    TensorFlow ops that the layer executes. Internally, many TensorFlow ops will
    do certain internal calculations in float32 or some other device-internal
    intermediate format with higher precision than float16/bfloat16, to increase
    numeric stability.

    For example, a `tf.keras.layers.Dense` layer, when run on a GPU with a
    float16 compute dtype, will pass float16 inputs to `tf.linalg.matmul`. But,
    `tf.linalg.matmul` will do use float32 intermediate math. The performance
    benefit of float16 is still apparent, due to increased memory bandwidth and
    the fact modern GPUs have specialized hardware for computing matmuls on
    float16 inputs while still keeping intermediate computations in float32.

  Warning: This class is now deprecated and will be removed soon. Please use the
  non-experimental class `tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy` instead.

  The difference between this class and the non-experimental class is that this

  loss scale is only used by `tf.keras.Model.compile`, which automatically wraps
  the optimizer with a `LossScaleOptimizer` if the optimizer is not already a

  When deserializing objects with an experimental policy using functions like
  `tf.keras.utils.deserialize_keras_object`, the policy will be deserialized as
  the non-experimental `tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy`, and the loss scale
  will silently be dropped. This is so that SavedModels that are generated
