def get_seed(seed): # -> tuple[Operation | _EagerTensorBase | Any | SymbolicTensor, Operation | _EagerTensorBase | Any]:
  """Returns the local seeds an operation should use given an op-specific seed.

  See `random_seed.get_seed` for more details. This wrapper adds support for
  the case where `seed` may be a tensor.

  Args:
    seed: An integer or a `tf.int64` scalar tensor.

  Returns:
    A tuple of two `tf.int64` scalar tensors that should be used for the local
    seed of the calling dataset.
