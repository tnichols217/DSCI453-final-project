"""Utility functions for comparing proto2 messages in Python.

ProtoEq() compares two proto2 messages for equality.

ClearDefaultValuedFields() recursively clears the fields that are set to their
default values. This is useful for comparing protocol buffers where the
semantics of unset fields and default valued fields are the same.

assertProtoEqual() is useful for unit tests.  It produces much more helpful
output than assertEqual() for proto2 messages, e.g. this:

  outer {
    inner {
-     strings: "x"
?               ^
+     strings: "y"
?               ^
    }
  }

...compared to the default output from assertEqual() that looks like this:

AssertionError: <my.Msg object at 0x9fb353c> != <my.Msg object at 0x9fb35cc>

Call it inside your unit test's googletest.TestCase subclasses like this:

  from tensorflow.python.util.protobuf import compare

  class MyTest(googletest.TestCase):
    ...
    def testXXX(self):
      ...
      compare.assertProtoEqual(self, a, b)

Alternatively:

  from tensorflow.python.util.protobuf import compare

  class MyTest(compare.ProtoAssertions, googletest.TestCase):
    ...
    def testXXX(self):
      ...
      self.assertProtoEqual(a, b)
"""
def isClose(x, y, relative_tolerance): # -> bool:
  """Returns True if x is close to y given the relative tolerance or if x and y are both inf, both -inf, or both NaNs.

  This function does not distinguish between signalling and non-signalling NaN.

  Args:
    x: float value to be compared
    y: float value to be compared
    relative_tolerance: float. The allowable difference between the two values
      being compared is determined by multiplying the relative tolerance by the
      maximum of the two values. If this is not provided, then all floats are
      compared using string comparison.

    check_initialized: boolean, whether to fail if either a or b isn't

    normalize_numbers: boolean, whether to normalize types and precision of
      numbers before comparison.
    msg: if specified, is used as the error message on failure.

      all floats are compared using string comparison otherwise, floating point

  Due to subtleties in the python protocol buffer implementation, it is possible
  for values to have different types and precision depending on whether they
  were set and retrieved directly or deserialized from a protobuf. This function
  normalizes integer values to ints and longs based on width, 32-bit floats to
  five digits of precision to account for python always storing them as 64-bit,
  and ensures doubles are floating point for when they're set to integers.

  Modifies pb in place. Recurses into nested objects.

  Returns:
    the given pb, modified in place.
