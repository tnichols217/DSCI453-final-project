  """Basic loop to train a model.

  Calls `train_step_fn` in a loop to train a model.  The function is called as:

  ```python
  train_step_fn(session, *args, **kwargs)
  ```

  It is passed a `tf.compat.v1.Session` in addition to `args` and `kwargs`.  The
  function
  typically runs one training step in the session.

  Args:
    supervisor: `tf.compat.v1.train.Supervisor` to run the training services.
    train_step_fn: Callable to execute one training step.  Called repeatedly as
      `train_step_fn(session, *args **kwargs)`.
    args: Optional positional arguments passed to `train_step_fn`.
    kwargs: Optional keyword arguments passed to `train_step_fn`.
    master: Master to use to create the training session.  Defaults to `""`
      which causes the session to be created in the local process.
