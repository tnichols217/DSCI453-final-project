  """Enable dumping debugging information from a TensorFlow program.

  The debugging information is dumped to a directory on the file system
  specified as `dump_root`.

  The dumped debugging information can be ingested by debugger UIs.

  The files in the dump directory contain the following information:
    - TensorFlow Function construction (e.g., compilation of Python functions
      decorated with @tf.function), the op types, names (if available), context,
      the input and output tensors, and the associated stack traces.
    - Execution of TensorFlow operations (ops) and Functions and their stack
      traces, op types, names (if available) and contexts. In addition,
      depending on the value of the `tensor_debug_mode` argument (see Args
      section below), the value(s) of the output tensors or more concise
      summaries of the tensor values will be dumped.
    - A snapshot of Python source files involved in the execution of the
      TensorFlow program.

  Once enabled, the dumping can be disabled with the corresponding
  `disable_dump_debug_info()` method under the same Python namespace.
  Calling this method more than once with the same `dump_root` is idempotent.
  Calling this method more than once with different `tensor_debug_mode`s
  leads to a `ValueError`.
  Calling this method more than once with different `circular_buffer_size`s
  leads to a `ValueError`.
  Calling this method with a different `dump_root` abolishes the
  previously-enabled `dump_root`.

  Usage example:

  ```py
  tf.debugging.experimental.enable_dump_debug_info('/tmp/my-tfdbg-dumps')

  # Code to build, train and run your TensorFlow model...
  ```

  NOTE: If your code is running on TPUs, be sure to call
  `tf.config.set_soft_device_placement(True)` before calling
  `tf.debugging.experimental.enable_dump_debug_info()` as this API uses
  automatic outside compilation on TPUs. For example:

  ```py
  tf.config.set_soft_device_placement(True)
  tf.debugging.experimental.enable_dump_debug_info(
      logdir, tensor_debug_mode="FULL_HEALTH")

  resolver = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver(tpu='')
  strategy = tf.distribute.TPUStrategy(resolver)
  with strategy.scope():
    # ...
  ```

  Args:
    dump_root: The directory path where the dumping information will be written.
    tensor_debug_mode: Debug mode for tensor values, as a string.
      The currently supported options are:
      - "NO_TENSOR": (Default) Only traces the output tensors of all executed
        ops (including those executed eagerly at the Python level or as a part
        of a TensorFlow graph) and functions, while not extracting any
        information from the values of the tensors.
      - "CURT_HEALTH": For each floating-dtype tensor (e.g., tensors of dtypes
        such as `float32`, `float64` and `bfloat16`), extracts a binary bit
        indicating whether it contains any -infinity, +infinity or NaN.
      - "CONCISE_HEALTH": For each floating-dtype tensor, extract total
        element count, and counts of -infinity, +infinity and NaN elements.
      - "FULL_HEALTH": For each floating-dtype tensor, extracts the dtype,
        rank (number of dimensions), total element count, and counts of
        -infinity, +infinity and NaN elements.
      - "SHAPE": For each tensor (regardless of dtype), extracts its dtype,
        rank, total element count and shape.
    circular_buffer_size: Size of the circular buffers for execution events.
      These circular buffers are designed to reduce the overhead of debugging
      dumping. They hold the most recent debug events concerning eager execution
      of ops and `tf.function`s and traces of tensor values computed inside
      `tf.function`s. They are written to the file system only when the proper
      flushing method is called (see description of return values below).
      Expected to be an integer. If <= 0, the circular-buffer behavior will be
      disabled, i.e., the execution debug events will be written to the file
      writers in the same way as non-execution events such as op creations and
      source-file snapshots.
    op_regex: Dump data from only the tensors from op types that matches to the
      regular expression (through Python's `re.match()`).
      "Op type" refers to the names of the TensorFlow operations (e.g.,
      "MatMul", "LogSoftmax"), which may repeat in a TensorFlow
      function. It does *not* refer to the names of nodes (e.g.,
      "dense/MatMul", "dense_1/MatMul_1") which are unique within a function.
      - Example 1: Dump tensor data from only MatMul and Relu ops
        `op_regex="^(MatMul|Relu)$"`.
      - Example 2: Dump tensors from all ops *except* Relu:
        `op_regex="(?!^Relu$)"`.
      This filter operates in a logical AND relation with `tensor_dtypes`.
    tensor_dtypes: Dump data from only the tensors of which the specified
      dtypes. This optional argument can be in any of the following format:
      - a list or tuple of `DType` objects or strings that can be converted
        to `DType` objects via `tf.as_dtype()`. Examples:
        - `tensor_dtype=[tf.float32, tf.float64]`,
        - `tensor_dtype=["float32", "float64"]`,
        - `tensor_dtypes=(tf.int32, tf.bool)`,
        - `tensor_dtypes=("int32", "bool")`
      - a callable that takes a single `DType` argument and returns a Python
        `boolean` indicating whether the dtype is to be included in the data
        dumping. Examples:
        - `tensor_dtype=lambda dtype: dtype.is_integer`.
      This filter operates in a logical AND relation with `op_regex`.
  Returns:
    A DebugEventsWriter instance used by the dumping callback. The caller
    may use its flushing methods, including `FlushNonExecutionFiles()` and
    `FlushExecutionFiles()`.
