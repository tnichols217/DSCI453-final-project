  For compatibility purposes, when invoked in TF2 where the outermost context is

  context available, and if so will forward this call to that writer instead. A
  "suitable" writer context means that the writer is set as the default writer,

  alternatively `tf.compat.v1.train.create_global_step`). For the forwarded

@tf_export(v1=['summary.image'])
def image(name, tensor, max_outputs=..., collections=..., family=...): # -> Operation | _EagerTensorBase | Any:
  """Outputs a `Summary` protocol buffer with images.

  The summary has up to `max_outputs` summary values containing images. The
  images are built from `tensor` which must be 4-D with shape `[batch_size,
  height, width, channels]` and where `channels` can be:

  *  1: `tensor` is interpreted as Grayscale.
  *  3: `tensor` is interpreted as RGB.
  *  4: `tensor` is interpreted as RGBA.

  The images have the same number of channels as the input tensor. For float
  input, the values are normalized one image at a time to fit in the range
  `[0, 255]`.  `uint8` values are unchanged.  The op uses two different
  normalization algorithms:

  *  If the input values are all positive, they are rescaled so the largest one
     is 255.

  *  If any input value is negative, the values are shifted so input value 0.0
     is at 127.  They are then rescaled so that either the smallest value is 0,
     or the largest one is 255.

  The `tag` in the outputted Summary.Value protobufs is generated based on the
  name, with a suffix depending on the max_outputs setting:

  *  If `max_outputs` is 1, the summary value tag is '*name*/image'.
  *  If `max_outputs` is greater than 1, the summary value tags are
     generated sequentially as '*name*/image/0', '*name*/image/1', etc.

  Args:
    name: A name for the generated node. Will also serve as a series name in
      TensorBoard.
    tensor: A 4-D `uint8` or `float32` `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, height,
      width, channels]` where `channels` is 1, 3, or 4.
    max_outputs: Max number of batch elements to generate images for.

@tf_export(v1=['summary.merge'])
def merge(inputs, collections=..., name=...): # -> Operation | _EagerTensorBase | Any:
  """Merges summaries.

  This op creates a
  [`Summary`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/framework/summary.proto)
  protocol buffer that contains the union of all the values in the input
  summaries.

  When the Op is run, it reports an `InvalidArgument` error if multiple values
  in the summaries to merge use the same tag.

  Args:
    inputs: A list of `string` `Tensor` objects containing serialized `Summary`
      protocol buffers.
    collections: Optional list of graph collections keys. The new summary op is
      added to these collections. Defaults to `[]`.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A scalar `Tensor` of type `string`. The serialized `Summary` protocol
    buffer resulting from the merging.

  Raises:
    RuntimeError: If called with eager mode enabled.

  @compatibility(TF2)
  This API is not compatible with eager execution or `tf.function`. To migrate
  to TF2, this API can be omitted entirely, because in TF2 individual summary
  ops, like `tf.summary.scalar()`, write directly to the default summary writer
  if one is active. Thus, it's not necessary to merge summaries or to manually
  add the resulting merged summary output to the writer. See the usage example
  shown below.

  TF 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/migrate#in_tf_1x).

  #### TF1 & TF2 Usage Example

  TF1:

  ```python
  dist = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, [100])
  tf.compat.v1.summary.histogram(name="distribution", values=dist)
  writer = tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter("/tmp/tf1_summary_example")
  summaries = tf.compat.v1.summary.merge_all()

  sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
  for step in range(100):
    mean_moving_normal = np.random.normal(loc=step, scale=1, size=[100])
    summ = sess.run(summaries, feed_dict={dist: mean_moving_normal})
    writer.add_summary(summ, global_step=step)
  ```

  TF2:

  ```python
  writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer("/tmp/tf2_summary_example")
  for step in range(100):
    mean_moving_normal = np.random.normal(loc=step, scale=1, size=[100])
    with writer.as_default(step=step):
      tf.summary.histogram(name='distribution', data=mean_moving_normal)
  ```
