  WARNING: Do not subclass this layer unless you know what you are doing:
  the API is subject to future changes.

  To distinguish between the concept of a feature family and a specific binary
  feature within a family, we refer to a feature family like "country" as a
  feature column. For example, we can have a feature in a `tf.Example` format:
    {key: "country",  value: [ "US" ]}
  In this example the value of feature is "US" and "country" refers to the
  column of the feature.

    Feature columns need to occasionally be sortable, for example when used as

    sequence being sorted.

    If any objects in the sequence being sorted do not have an `__lt__` method
    compatible with feature column objects (such as strings), then CPython will
