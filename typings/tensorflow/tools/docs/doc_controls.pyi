  ```
  /Child.md

  Note: This is implemented by adding a hidden attribute on the object, so it
  cannot be used on objects which do not allow new attributes to be added. So
  this decorator must go *below* `@property`, `@classmethod`,

  ```
  class Example(object):

    @do_not_generate_docs
    def x(self):
      return self._x

  This version of the decorator is "inherited" by subclasses. No docs will be
  generated for the decorated method in any subclass. Even if the sub-class
  overrides the method.

  For example, to ensure that `method1` is **never documented** use this
  decorator on the base-class:

  ```
  class Parent(object):
    @do_not_doc_inheritable
    def method1(self):

  /Parent.md
    # method2
  /Child.md

  When generating docs for a class's arributes, the `__mro__` is searched and
  the attribute will be skipped if this decorator is detected on the attribute
  on any class in the `__mro__`.

  public method, essential for anyone implementing a subclass, but it should
  never be called directly.

  Works on method, or other class-attributes.
